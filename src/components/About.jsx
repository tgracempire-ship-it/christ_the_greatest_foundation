            <p>Christ the Greatest Foundation is an indigenous humanitarian organization based in Iju, Akure North LGA, Ondo State — built from a single conviction: that poverty should never decide who gets to learn, belong, or be treated with dignity.</p>
            <p>What began as a tuition-free classroom in Iju has grown into a network of programs reaching pupils in neighbouring schools, inmates in correctional facilities, and community members training for ministry and leadership.</p>
